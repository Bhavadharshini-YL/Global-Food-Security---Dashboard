Global Food Security Analysis and Insights

1)Introduction

Food security is one of the most critical challenges facing the world today. While millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition, trillions of tons of food are wasted every year. According to the UN, approximately 1/3rd of all food produced is wasted, contributing not only to hunger but also to environmental and economic losses. This project explores the paradox of global food waste and hunger using multiple datasets. The objective is to uncover insights that emphasize the urgent need for sustainable food management practices.
