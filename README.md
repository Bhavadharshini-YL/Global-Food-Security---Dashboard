# Global Food Security Analysis and Insights

## 1)Introduction
Food security is one of the most critical challenges facing the world today. While millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition, trillions of tons of food are wasted every year. According to the UN, approximately 1/3rd of all food produced is wasted, contributing not only to hunger but also to environmental and economic losses. This project explores the paradox of global food waste and hunger using multiple datasets. The objective is to uncover insights that emphasize the urgent need for sustainable food management practices.

## 3) Questions

- How much food is wasted per person globally each year?
- What is the total global economic loss due to food waste?
- How is food waste distributed across households, retail, and out-of-home sectors over time?
- Which food categories contribute the most to economic loss?
- Which countries contribute the most to food waste globally?
- What is the trend of global food waste and hunger index over the years?
- How many undernourished people exist globally?
- Which country/region has the highest food waste and which has the highest hunger index?
- How many millions of people could be fed with the wasted food each year?
- What is the relationship between food waste and hunger levels across countries?

## Key Contributions

- Designed an interactive dashboard connecting global food waste with hunger index to highlight critical social and economic issues.
- Cleaned, standardized, and merged four datasets (Food Waste, Hunger Index, Economic Loss, Categories) to enable country-wise and category-wise analysis.
- Built impactful visualizations: KPIs, distribution charts, economic impact donut, top contributors, waste-to-hunger scatter, and trend analysis.
- Delivered actionable insights showing how reducing waste can significantly reduce hunger and economic losses worldwide.

## Process
- Data Collection & Cleaning
Combined multiple datasets (waste per capita, categories, hunger index).
Standardized country names and aligned years for comparability.

- Data Integration
Merged hunger data with food waste indicators.
Calculated derived fields: per capita waste, economic loss, potential meals saved.

- Dashboard Design
Created KPIs for waste, economic loss, hunger index, and undernourishment.
Used maps, scatter plots, bar charts, treemaps, and time series to show different perspectives.
Added storytelling flow: Problem → Scale → Impact → Solution.

- Validation & Insights
Cross-verified trends with global hunger reports to ensure credibility.
Highlighted contrasts between developed vs developing countries.
